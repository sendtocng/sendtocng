            <div class="article-body">
                <p>If you have money in a traditional bank, you're probably earning around 0.01% APY on your savings. That's nothing. Literally nothing. You'd need $100,000 in the bank to earn about $10 per year.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, in DeFi (decentralized finance), people are earning 10%, 15%, even 20% on their crypto holdings. That $100,000 would earn you $10,000 per year in the right DeFi setup. That's a real difference.</p>

                <h2>Wait, How Does That Work?</h2>
                <p>Here's the simple version: DeFi cuts out the middleman.</p>

                <p>When you put money in a bank, the bank takes your money and lends it out to other people. They make money on the interest. They give you a tiny slice. That's how banks work.</p>

                <p>DeFi does the same thing, but there's no bank. Instead, there's code. Smart contracts automatically match people who need loans with people who have extra money. When you lend your crypto, you earn interest directly. When someone borrows, they pay interest. The difference between what the borrower pays and what you earn? You keep most of it instead of giving it to a bank.</p>

                <p>You become the bank. Sort of.</p>

                <h2>What's the Catch?</h2>
                <p>Here's where I have to be honest with you. There are real risks here. This isn't a sponsored message. You need to know what you're getting into.</p>

                <p><strong>Volatility.</strong></p>
                <p>Crypto prices go up and down. A lot. If you put $10,000 in DeFi and the underlying crypto drops 30% in a week, you now have $7,000 in DeFi. Your yield earnings might not make up for that loss. The 10% APY sounds great, but it doesn't account for the price dropping. You're not just earning interest. You're also holding an asset that can lose value.</p>

                <p><strong>Smart contract risk.</strong></p>
                <p>DeFi runs on code. Code can have bugs. Sometimes hackers find those bugs and drain money from protocols. It's not common with the big, audited projects, but it happens. You're trusting code instead of a bank. Banks have regulations and insurance. DeFi has code and hubris.</p>

                <p><strong>You're your own bank.</strong></p>
                <p>This is the big one. When you use DeFi, there's no customer service number to call. There's no FDIC insurance protecting your money. If you mess up your transaction or send money to the wrong address, it's gone. There's no "oops, let me reverse that" button. You have full control, which means you have full responsibility.</p>

                <p><strong>Liquidity risk.</strong></p>
                <p>Some DeFi investments lock your money up for a period of time. You can't just pull your money out whenever you want. If you need cash fast, this could be a problem.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>DeFi isn't a scam, but it's not magic either. People really are earning yield. But it's not free money. It's compensation for taking real risks that banks normally handle for you.</p>

                <p>If you want to try DeFi, start small. Put in what you can afford to lose. Learn how transactions work. Don't chase the highest APY you see. The highest usually has the highest risk.</p>

                <p>Never invest more than you can afford to lose. That's true for everything in crypto, but especially here.</p>
