            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Here's something you don't see every day: a crypto trading platform just dropped $29 million to hire a famous lawyer and lobby Washington.</p>

                <p>That's exactly what <strong>Hyperliquid</strong> did this week. The crypto derivatives exchange — one of the biggest in the world — launched the Hyperliquid Policy Center, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit aimed at shaping how the US government regulates decentralized finance.</p>

                <h2>Who's Behind It</h2>

                <p>The group is being led by <strong>Jake Chervinsky</strong>, one of the most well-known crypto lawyers in Washington. He previously served as policy head at the Blockchain Association, one of the biggest crypto trade groups in DC.</p>

                <p>In a statement, Chervinsky didn't mince words: <em>"Financial markets are migrating onto public blockchains because they offer efficiency, transparency and resilience that legacy systems cannot match. Now the United States must choose: We can either adopt new rules that allow this innovation to flourish here at home, or we can wait and watch as other nations seize the opportunity."</em></p>

                <h2>Why $29 Million Matters</h2>

                <p>Let me put that number in perspective. According to public filings, the Blockchain Association spent $8.3 million in 2024. The Digital Chamber spent $5.6 million. Hyperliquid's $29 million token commitment isn't just big — it's roughly 3-5x what the existing major crypto policy groups are spending.</p>

                <p>That's a serious signal that the DeFi industry is done waiting for clear rules and is now actively trying to write them.</p>

                <h2>What They're Actually Pushing For</h2>

                <p>The Hyperliquid Policy Center has a few specific targets:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decentralized exchanges</strong> — pushing for rules that recognize onchain trading without a central intermediary</li>
                    <li><strong>Perpetual futures</strong> — the $250 billion+ market that happens almost entirely offshore</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain market infrastructure</strong> — broader rules that accommodate DeFi innovation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's why perps are a big deal: These are leveraged trading contracts with no expiration date. They're enormously popular in crypto — Hyperliquid alone processed over $250 billion in perp trading last month — but they exist in a regulatory gray area in the US. The center wants to change that.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters for You</h2>

                <p>Here's the practical reality: right now, most perpetual futures trading happens on offshore exchanges because US regulations aren't clear. That means American traders are either using offshore platforms in a legal gray zone, or they're locked out of some of the most liquid markets in crypto.</p>

                <p>If Hyperliquid's policy push works, we could see:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clearer rules for onchain trading in the US</li>
                    <li>More platforms offering perp futures to US customers legally</li>
                    <li>A seat at the table for DeFi developers instead of just traditional finance players</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Or, the regulations could go the other way — making it harder for anyone to trade perps. That's exactly why Hyperliquid is spending this money now: because the rules being written right now will determine what crypto trading looks like for the next decade.</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

                <p>This is part of a larger trend. Crypto companies are realizing that if they want to operate in the US, they need to play Washington's game. Ripple did it. Coinbase does it. Now Hyperliquid is jumping in with both feet.</p>

                <p>The difference? Hyperliquid is a DeFi-native platform — not a traditional exchange pretending to care about blockchain. They're arguing that decentralized infrastructure deserves its own regulatory category, not the same rules meant for centralized brokers.</p>

                <p>Whether that argument wins — and what it means for the future of trading crypto — is something we'll all find out in the next couple of years.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 8px;">Q: What is Hyperliquid?</p>
                        <p style="color: var(--gray-dark); margin: 0;">Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that lets users trade perpetual futures directly on blockchain without a central intermediary. It's become one of the biggest crypto derivatives platforms in the world — processing over $250 billion in trading volume last month.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 8px;">Q: What are perpetual futures?</p>
                        <p style="color: var(--gray-dark); margin: 0;">Perpetual futures are like regular futures contracts, but they never expire — you can hold a leveraged position as long as you want. They're the most popular way to trade crypto with leverage, but they're largely unregulated in the US.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 8px;">Q: Why does this matter for regular traders?</p>
                        <p style="color: var(--gray-dark); margin: 0;">If Hyperliquid's lobbying works, we could see clearer regulations that allow more crypto trading platforms to operate legally in the US. That means more options, better liquidity, and less risk of using offshore platforms. If it goes the other way, perp trading could get even more restricted.</p>
