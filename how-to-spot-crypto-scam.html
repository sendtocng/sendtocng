            <div class="article-body">
                <p>I've been in crypto for years. I've seen the hacks, the rug pulls, the "too good to be true" projects that vanished overnight. And through all of it, I've built a simple rule: if something feels off, I walk away.</p>

                <p>But not everyone has that instinct. Not everyone knows what to look for. And that's exactly why scammers thrive.</p>

                <p>So let's talk about it. Here's how to spot a crypto scam in 2026.</p>

                <h2>The "Too Good to Be True" Returns</h2>
                <p>This is the oldest trick in the book, and it still works.</p>
                <p>Someone DMs you or posts in a group: "Guaranteed 50% returns in 24 hours!" or "Stake your crypto here for 100% APY!"</p>
                <p>Here's the truth: <strong>legitimate DeFi yields are between 2-15%</strong>. Anything claiming 30%, 50%, 100%? That's not a yield. That's a trap. The scammer is paying you with other victims' money until the scheme collapses.</p>
                <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Anyone guaranteeing returns.</p>

                <h2>Fake Exchanges & Wallets</h2>
                <p>You search for "Coinbase" or "MetaMask" and click the first link. It looks exactly like the real site. You enter your seed phrase to "connect your wallet."</p>
                <p>Next thing you know, your wallet is drained.</p>
                <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Links in DMs, links from strangers, any site asking for your seed phrase. Real exchanges and wallets will NEVER ask for your seed phrase.</p>

                <h2>Rug Pulls</h2>
                <p>A new token launches. The Telegram group is buzzing. Influencers are hyping it. The price goes up. People are making money.</p>
                <p>Then suddenly, the developers dump their holdings. The price crashes to zero. The Telegram group disappears. The website goes offline.</p>
                <p>This happens every day.</p>
                <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> No audit, anonymous team, suspiciously low liquidity, Telegram groups pushing FOMO.</p>

                <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <p>You get an email: "Urgent: Your account has been compromised. Click here to secure your funds."</p>
                <p>Or a DM: "Hey, you dropped your wallet address" with a malicious link.</p>
                <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Unexpected messages about your accounts. Always check the sender. Always verify URLs manually.</p>

                <h2>Fake Giveaways</h2>
                <p>"Send 0.1 ETH to get 1 ETH back! Verified by [fake celebrity]!"</p>
                <p>This one is painfully obvious, but people still fall for it. Scammers clone accounts of famous people in crypto, reply to posts, create fake legitimacy.</p>
                <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Any "send crypto to get more crypto" scheme. That's not how giveaways work.</p>

                <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
                <p>Here's what I do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never share your seed phrase.</strong> Ever. Not with anyone. Not for any reason.</li>
                    <li><strong>Double-check every URL.</strong> Bookmark your exchanges and wallet sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify before you trust.</strong> Search for project audits. Check if the team is doxxed. Look for red flags.</li>
                    <li><strong>If it's urgent, it's a scam.</strong> Real platforms don't create panic to rush your decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>When in doubt, ask.</strong> There's no shame in asking before sending money.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Scammers are getting smarter. The scams look more legitimate. But the core rule hasn't changed: if it sounds too good to be true, it is.</p>
                <p>I can't stop scammers. But I can help you recognize them before they get you.</p>
                <p>Stay safe out there.</p>
