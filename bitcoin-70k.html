                <p>Bitcoin just crossed $70,000. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that's huge. But if you're new, you might be wondering why you should care.</p>

                <p>Here's the thing: this isn't just another number going up. This is the moment where crypto stops being a fringe thing your weird uncle talks about and starts being something your financial advisor mentions.</p>

                <h2>What's Actually Happening</h2>
                <p>Let's break down why this matters:</p>

                <p><strong>Regular people can now buy Bitcoin through their regular brokerage accounts.</strong></p>
                <p>Think Robinhood, Fidelity, Charles Schwab. You don't need to learn about crypto exchanges or deal with weird passwords or figure out "wallets." You just buy it like you'd buy Apple stock. This happened through something called ETFs, which are basically basket funds that hold Bitcoin for you. It sounds boring, but it's a massive shift because it means Bitcoin is now accessible to anyone with a brokerage account.</p>

                <p><strong>Big companies are holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets.</strong></p>
                <p>MicroStrategy is the famous one — they've bought billions worth. But they're not alone. Companies like Square, Tesla, and even some hedge funds have added Bitcoin to their treasuries. Why? Because they're treating it like digital gold. It's a store of value that can't be inflated away by printing more of it.</p>

                <p><strong>Countries are getting involved.</strong></p>
                <p>El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. Other countries are considering similar moves. Some central banks are even working on their own digital currencies. The point is, governments are no longer ignoring this.</p>

                <h2>So What Does This Mean for You?</h2>
                <p>If you've been waiting for a sign to pay attention to crypto, this might be it. The infrastructure is built. The institutions are here. The question isn't whether crypto goes mainstream anymore. It's whether you'll understand it before your neighbors do.</p>

                <p>You don't have to become a trader or start buying altcoins. Just understanding what's happening gives you an edge in conversations and in your financial literacy.</p>

                <p>We're here to help you get it. No jargon. No hype. Just what you need to know.</p>
