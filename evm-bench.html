                <p>OpenAI just dropped something interesting for the crypto world — and it's not a token.</p>

                <p>Teaming up with <strong>Paradigm</strong> (the crypto investment firm behind Uniswap and dozens of other DeFi protocols), they've released <strong>evm-bench</strong>. That's a tool that measures how well AI agents perform when dealing with smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.</p>

                <h2>What does it actually do?</h2>
                <p>Think of it like a driving test — but for AI agents trying to navigate the crypto ecosystem. The tool runs AI models through various scenarios involving:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading and understanding smart contract code</li>
                    <li>Executing transactions on DeFi protocols</li>
                    <li>Navigating multi-step financial operations</li>
                    <li>Handling edge cases and failures</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
                <p>Right now, a lot of "AI agents" in crypto are pretty limited. They can answer questions, summarize docs, maybe execute a simple trade. But actually interacting with complex DeFi protocols? That's harder.</p>

                <p>evm-bench gives developers a standardized way to test and improve AI agents for real-world crypto tasks. It's a benchmark — like how ImageNet changed computer vision, this could become the standard for measuring AI in DeFi.</p>

                <p>And with crypto trading volumes hitting hundreds of billions daily, the opportunity for AI agents to actually do useful work (not just pump tokens on social media) is huge.</p>

                <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
                <p>This collaboration is interesting. OpenAI is the big dog in AI. Paradigm is one of the most respected crypto-native investment firms. When they team up on something, it's worth paying attention to.</p>

                <p>Whether this leads to AI agents that can actually manage your DeFi positions, execute sophisticated trading strategies, or spot vulnerabilities in smart contracts — we don't know yet. But having a benchmark to measure progress is the first step.</p>

                <p>The question is: how long until your AI assistant can do your DeFi farming for you?</p>
