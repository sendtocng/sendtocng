            <div class="article-body">
                <p>NFTs got famous for selling monkey pictures for millions of dollars. Easy to mock. Hard to understand what the hell is actually going on.</p>

                <p>But here's what the jokes miss: NFTs are about something much bigger than JPEG files. They're about <strong>digital ownership</strong>.</p>

                <h2>What Actually Is an NFT?</h2>
                <p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. That's a technical term that doesn't help anyone. Let me translate:</p>

                <p>An NFT is a unique digital item that only you own. Not a platform. Not a company. You.</p>

                <p>Think about how ownership works in the physical world. You buy a house, you get a deed. That deed proves you own it. Even if someone else builds a copy of your house, they don't have your deed. They don't own your house.</p>

                <p>NFTs do the same thing for digital stuff. The NFT is the deed. The blockchain is the public record proving you have the deed. Anyone can copy the image, but only you have the NFT that proves ownership.</p>

                <p>It can be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Art and images</li>
                    <li>Music rights and royalties</li>
                    <li>Video game items and skins</li>
                    <li>Event tickets</li>
                    <li>Domain names</li>
                    <li>Your identity and credentials</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>Right now, when you buy digital stuff, you don't actually own it. You rent it. You buy a skin in a game, and the company can take it away. You buy a song on iTunes, and Apple can remove it from your account. You buy a course online, and the platform can delete your access.</p>

                <p>That's wild when you think about it. You paid for it, but you don't own it.</p>

                <p>NFTs fix that. When you buy an NFT, the ownership is on the blockchain. No company can take it away. No server can go down and delete your purchase. It's yours in a way that nothing else in the digital world has been.</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>Yes, people are still selling monkey pictures for too much money. That part is ridiculous. But underneath the speculation and the memes, there's a real shift happening. We're moving from a world where platforms own everything to a world where you own your stuff.</p>

                <p>That's worth paying attention to.</p>
