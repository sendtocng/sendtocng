# OpenFridge - Full Project Brief

## Core Product
AI-powered app that turns fridge photos into creative recipe suggestions. Content/personality-driven alternative to boring recipe databases.

## User Flow
1. User snaps photo of fridge/pantry
2. AI recognizes ingredients via vision API
3. Generate 3 creative recipe options (original, not database matches)
4. Each recipe has personality + "Fridge Savior Rating" (desperation scale)

## UI Vision
- Retro-futuristic 1950s fridge aesthetic
- Mint green + cream colors
- Warm glows
- Gorgeous, delightful, makes people say "oh wow"

## Key Differentiation
- PERSONALITY in copy (normie translator voice like CryptoNews)
- AI generates ORIGINAL creative recipes (not just matching databases)
- Rating system: "Actually Fire" / "Surprisingly Edible" / "Technically Food"
- Solves "it's 9pm, I don't want to spend $15 on delivery" problem
- Entertainment + utility (not sterile like competitors)

## Technical Stack
- Vision API for ingredient recognition (GPT-4 Vision or Claude)
- Recipe generation: creative/experimental (stoned chef genius combinations)
- Mobile-first design
- Speed is critical

## Brandon's Context
- 3-week sprint to launch
- Can code but needs clean foundation
- Will iterate fast
- Content-led launch (Instagram Reels)
- Has made fire meals from random fridge ingredients at 9pm
- App should capture that creative desperation → surprising success energy

## First Iteration MVP
- Basic photo upload/camera interface
- Ingredient recognition working
- Recipe generation with 3 creative options
- Simple but gorgeous UI framework (retro aesthetic)
- Your voice in the UX copy

## Voice/Copy Style
- Lead with personality
- Normie translator (like CryptoNews)
- Self-deprecating, relatable
- Make desperation cooking sound creative, not sad
- "Actually Fire" / "Surprisingly Edible" / "Technically Food" rating tiers

## Competitors to Beat
- SuperCook (11M recipes, free)
- Fridge AI, FridgeScanner, Chef AI
- We win on PERSONALITY + ENTERTAINMENT, not features
