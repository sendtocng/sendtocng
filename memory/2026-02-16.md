## CryptoNews.Global - SEO Fixes

### What We Did
- Created static HTML article pages (bitcoin-70k.html, defi-explained.html) instead of JavaScript-loaded content
- This fixes SEO: search engines can now read article content, social media previews work
- Fixed article styling issues - added article-styles.css, fixed HTML structure

### Issues Encountered
- GitHub Pages kept disabling itself (possibly due to force pushes)
- Had to re-enable it multiple times at: https://github.com/sendtocng/sendtocng/settings/pages

### Files Changed
- article-styles.css (new)
- bitcoin-70k.html (new static page)
- defi-explained.html (new static page)
- script.js (updated to link to static pages)

### Repo Details
- Main repo: https://github.com/sendtocng/sendtocng
- Live site: https://cryptonews.global (when GitHub Pages is enabled)

### Still Needed
- Clean up workspace files (AGENTS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, etc. got accidentally committed)

## Article Template
- Created `article-template.html` - use this for new articles
- Always include: title, date, reading time (X min read), subtitle, tags, meta description
- Reading time formula: ~200 words per minute
- Tags must link to `index.html?tag=TagName`
- Use article-styles.css for styling
