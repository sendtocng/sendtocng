## What We Fixed Today
- Removed BMW folder from repo (was unrelated)
- Removed memory/ folder (shouldn't be in crypto news repo)
- Removed bookmywalks submodule (was cluttering repo)
- Fixed articleUrls - added missing article 7 (Strategy Bitcoin Bet)
- Site now shows 8 articles total

## Lessons Learned
- GitHub Pages deploys from main branch automatically
- DON'T use `git submodule` - causes messy commits
- DO check git status before pushing
- Each project should ideally be its own repo

## OpenFridge
- NOT in this workspace anymore
- Was cleaned up accidentally - needs new repo
- User's friend has their own OpenClaw for BookMyWalks

## User Preferences
- Voice: "For normies, by normies" - conversational, no jargon
- Keep things simple, explain like to a friend
- Be concise, not corporate
