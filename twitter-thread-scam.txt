**🧵 How to Spot a Crypto Scam in 2026**

No one should get rugged. Here's how to spot crypto scams before they take your money 👇

1/

Crypto scams are getting smarter. But the red flags are the same:

• "Guaranteed 50% returns" → scam
• Anyone asking for your seed phrase → scam  
• New token with anonymous team + low liquidity → probably rug pull

2/

🔴 RED FLAGS:
- Unverified links in DMs
- "Urgent" messages about your account
- "Send 0.1 to get 1 back" giveaways
- Projects with no audit
- Telegram groups pushing FOMO

3/

✅ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF:
- Never share your seed phrase. EVER.
- Bookmark your exchange sites
- Verify URLs manually
- If it's urgent, it's a scam
- When in doubt, ask

4/

The truth: legitimate DeFi yields are 2-15%.
Anything claiming 30%+, you're the product.

Stay safe out there.
